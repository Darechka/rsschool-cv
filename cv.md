## About Myself
Last year I decided to change my career path. Because of my natural perfectionism, passion for quality and great interest in the information technology, I made a decision to become a QA engineer. So I started to learn software testing.

By now, I’ve taken the following steps on the path to my dream job:
* completed *Functional Software Testing* course at IT-Academy
* read books on software testing by R. Savin and S. Kulikov
* watched educational videos on the YouTube channels of Artsiom Rusau, Mikhail Portnov, Olga Nazina, Hillel IT School
* completed SQL Basics course on stepik.org
* learned HTML and CSS basics on w3schools.com

And I keep on studying. Right now I’m taking a practical course in Software Testing by Vadim Ksendzov. Besides, I’ve started to learn JavaScript and now I’m also taking the *"JavaScript/Front-end. Stage 0"* course at RS School.

I hope to find my first job in the IT world soon, and I’m full of enthusiasm to work hard, study a lot and develop my skills.

## Code Example

**Task:**

*Create ***evenFn(n)*** function that accepts a number as an argument. The argument (n) sets the number of loop iterations.The function must return an array consisting of even numbers that are generated in each iteration of the loop.*

***Note:***
 * *0 (zero) must not be included in the resulting array*
 * *the loop must be executed up to ***n*** times (including ***n***)*
 * *only "for" loop can be used in this task*

**My code:**
```javascript
function evenFn(n) {
    let arr = [];
    for(let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        if(i%2 == 0 && i != 0) {
            arr.push(i);
        }
    }
    return arr;
}
console.log(evenFn(10)); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(evenFn(15)); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
console.log(evenFn(20)); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
```
